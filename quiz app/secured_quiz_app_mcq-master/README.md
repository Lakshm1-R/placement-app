working:
there is a first page ,which has the start button for the test.
when the user clicks on the start button,call-back function is triggered which checks whether the user turns on the internet or not.if the internet is on,it ask to turn off to start.if the internet is on ,test will start.

when the test get started,there will be a question section,options section and prev,next buttons to navigate through questions in the main page.only the contents changes in the main page,when the next and prev buttons get clicked ,the contents of the question section,and its option section gets 
changed.

while attending the test ,if the user tries to switch apps or turn on the internet,the test will get stopped.

the user can attend the test only once.How i have implemented is that i stored flag in the local storage.if the user wants to attend the test again.they have uninstall and reinstall the app to attend the test again.
